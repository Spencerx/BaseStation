# BaseStation
Base Station is an attempt to create a Android based user interface for common UHF/VHF radio boards such as the RS-UV3A, the DRA-818 series boards.

# Features
Radio control: Change frequency, change offset (offsets calculated internally), change volume, change squelch, enable and set CTCSS (TX only). Transmit and save current settings as channel.
Channels: Unlimited channels, delete channel and scan channels.

# Supported Boards
Base station currently supports the RS-UV3A and has currently unused support for the DRA-818 boards. I plan to fix support for the DRA-818 and add support for the Ham Sheild.

# Supported comms
1. USB cable
2. Bluetooth (Bluetooth to Serial dongle)
